        This game is based off of the classic arcade game, Pacman. The design and layout were inspired by the retro arcade machines of the 1980s, from the "insert coin" to the scoreboard on the left of the page.
        There are a few unique features to this Pacman-inspired matching game. When like tiles are selected, a sound bit from the original game is played based on the specific tiles that were matched. When the player
        beats the game, the option to restart the game pops up. In addition, whenever the player matches the fruit tiles, they are added to the inventory on the right hand side of the page.

    Skills:

    <p>In order to make this game, I used various JS, CSS, and HTML skills to structure and make the game functional. I utilized for loops and many conditionals to create the conditions of the game. In addition to using javascript for the functionality of the page
        , the page relied heavily on CSS properties to make it look the way it does. A basic understanding of HTML structure was needed to create the skeleton layout for the page, and the CSS finished the job by styling the rest of the page.</p>
